1
00:00:01,114 --> 00:00:07,309
(music)

2
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,500
- Apocrypha comes from
a Greek word apokryphos,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,859
which means to hide, what is hidden.

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:17,109
And the English word apocryphal
has come to mean false.

5
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:20,690
So when people talk about the Apocrypha,

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,899
as Protestants, as a
Protestant Evangelical,

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:25,870
I'm talking about additional books

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,500
that I don't believe
are part of the canon,

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,059
but additional books that
some Christian traditions,

10
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,649
like Catholicism, and Eastern Orthodoxy

11
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,149
include within their Old Testament canon.

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,770
There's no debate about the
content of the New Testament

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,829
among major Christian traditions.

14
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,329
It's as some people
have said, it's amazing

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,679
when you look at the diversity
and geographical spread,

16
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,780
and there's this affirmation

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,710
of the 27 book New Testament
canon that we have.

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,009
But depending on how you divide it up,

19
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,859
because there's portions
of books and so on,

20
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,670
whether it's 12 additional books,

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,939
or for Eastern Orthodoxy
there's even more.

22
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,400
Where did these books come from?

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,819
And why do Protestants

24
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,650
not believe they're part of the canon?

25
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,599
The easy explanation for this is to say

26
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,040
Jesus and the apostles didn't believe

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,109
this was part of the canon.

28
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,069
The Jews who wrote these books in the time

29
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,799
between the Old and New Testament

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,409
never included it in their canon,

31
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,780
they're not in the
synagogue that you go to,

32
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,700
they're not quoted as Scripture,

33
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,849
with as the Scripture
says, as Word of God says,

34
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:30,140
they're not quoted as
Scripture in the New Testament.

35
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,879
And so we don't believe that those

36
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,010
should be included within our canon.

37
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,540
The Apocrypha also contains
clear historical error,

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,189
unlike the Old and New
Testament Scriptures.

39
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,069
You can see lists of
these errors, for example

40
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,739
in Paul Wagner's book The Journey
from Text to Translations.

41
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,299
The Catholic Church, there
were certain regional councils

42
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,799
that affirmed books of the Apocrypha,

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,426
but a church-wide council
did not affirm the Apocrypha

44
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:04,370
as Scripture within the Catholic Church,

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,569
until the Council of Trent in 1546,

46
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,569
in reaction against the
Protestant Reformation.

47
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,819
So that should give us pause

48
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,240
if we don't have a church-wide
council affirming those books

49
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,569
until a reaction against Protestants.

50
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,259
And having said that, I
teach at a Baptist Seminary,

51
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,349
and so many times students who come

52
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,400
from the Baptist tradition
are very skeptical

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,939
about the Apocrypha,
they think it's almost

54
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:32,560
like an evil book, don't read it.

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,669
But I think that's wrong.

56
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:37,699
I mean these are books that
are written by early Jews

57
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,039
who were seeking to live a life,

58
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,300
many times pleasing to God,
there's a diversity within it,

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,069
but portions of the Apocrypha,

60
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,000
sound just like the Psalms,

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,969
calling out to God in
praise for His attributes.

62
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,900
There's a beautiful passage
in Sirach 38 about physicians,

63
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,103
that don't despise the physician,
pray to God for healing,

64
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:02,069
but don't be afraid to go to the physician

65
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,560
because God's given him wisdom
about the herbs of the Earth

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,039
and how they can heal you too.

67
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:10,689
So we read this and we think
this is people seeking to live,

68
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,319
to serve God many times,
I've always thought

69
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,969
the Book of Tobit would make
an amazing Disney movie.

70
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:19,629
It's not Scripture, but if
you read the Book of Tobit,

71
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:24,310
it has love, it has intrigue,
and it's really enjoyable

72
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,840
to read as a book, but it's not Scripture.

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,879
We can also when we read the Apocrypha,

74
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,569
it can help us understand what happened

75
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,629
between the last book of the Old Testament

76
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,500
and Jesus's ministry.

77
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,051
And where did these Pharisees come from?

78
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,340
Where did these Sadducees come from?

79
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,750
That story is told
really in the Apocrypha,

80
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,284
you read 1 and 2 Maccabees.

81
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,770
And so it gives us helpful
historical background.

82
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,479
Within the Protestant
tradition, I've found

83
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,639
that there are really two strands.

84
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,960
There's a strand that ends
up in sort of Anglicanism,

85
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,460
the English Church, and
then there's a strand

86
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,090
that's more like Baptist and Presbyterian,

87
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,919
and I guess Lutheranism would
be over here with Anglicanism,

88
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,960
and they will use words from the Apocrypha

89
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,060
for hymns and other things like that,

90
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,360
they don't believe it's Scripture.

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,949
But within the Baptist and
more Presbyterian tradition,

92
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,170
it's really only looked at as valuable

93
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,860
for historical background many times.

94
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,540
But if you look in your hymnal,

95
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,199
sometimes we even sing hymns
based on the Apocrypha,

96
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,220
but it usually doesn't
say that in our hymnal.

97
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,579
For example, the famous hymn
"Now Thank We All Our God"

98
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:37,709
which is in the Baptist hymnal,

99
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:40,639
is based on Sirach 50,
almost word for word,

100
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,850
this beautiful hymn to God.

101
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,060
Now thank we all our God, with
hearts and hands and voices,

102
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,550
who wondrous things has done,
in whom this world rejoices.

103
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,726
Or the famous Christmas carol

104
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:51,240
"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear"

105
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,730
is based upon a text out of the Apocrypha.

106
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,649
So the Apocrypha's not Scripture,

107
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,550
but it is helpful sometimes to understand

108
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,850
the things that happened
between the Testaments.

109
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,649
And some Christian
traditions have written hymns

110
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,939
and other things that use

111
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,666
some of the wording of the Apocrypha.

112
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,250
