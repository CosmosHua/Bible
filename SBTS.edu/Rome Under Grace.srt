1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,480
- All right, girls, let's go,

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,500
it's time to go to school.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,430
Have you got everything?

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,160
You got your backpacks?
- Yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,200
- All right, let's go.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,028
You got it, you got it.

7
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:15,672
(giggling)

8
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:16,505
You sure you got everything?

9
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,543
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:21,604
(door slamming)

11
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:30,187
(dramatic music)

12
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:37,340
(bells ringing)

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,600
So, a question I often
get asked is, is why Rome?

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,940
Isn't that one of the most
religious cities in the world?

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,220
You've got the Vatican there,
you have the Pope there.

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,960
It's one of the most Christian
places in the world, so,

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,260
what's the point of having someone there

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,090
planning churches and sharing the gospel

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,490
if it's already there?

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,060
That's a product of a
huge misunderstanding

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,850
about Roman Catholicism.

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,620
Rome as a city is full of religion

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,540
but it's void of the gospel.

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,080
You walk around and every corner,

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,190
there's signs of this desire
to do something for God,

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,850
whether you go to see the Holy Steps,

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,250
people climbing on their knees,

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,700
they're climbing and doing something

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,250
to draw closer to God, but
God is this far off figure

30
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,800
who's at the top of these
stairs figuratively speaking

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,810
and you're trying to get to Him,

32
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,510
showing Him how contrite your heart is.

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,550
But the gospel's the total opposite.

34
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,050
It's God who came down to us to grab us

35
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,060
and say there's nothing that you can do.

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,280
I've done it for you through Jesus Christ,

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,360
so it's Christ who steps in your place

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,050
and takes those sins from you.

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,140
And so what we see at the
heart of Roman Catholicism

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,210
is a false gospel.

41
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,520
Rome becomes, then, one of the
darkest places in the world.

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:10,470
You definitely realize the
vastness of lostness here.

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,250
Kyra and I were married
in December of 2006.

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,350
We moved up to Louisville
to attend Southern Seminary.

45
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,370
It was there that we
sensed the Lord calling us

46
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,980
to serve abroad.

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,410
The Lord made it very clear
that Rome was the place

48
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,080
we were to serve, so
we lived in Louisville

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,730
for two years until summer of 2009

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,098
when we moved abroad to Rome.

51
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:33,050
A few months after we arrived,

52
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,930
we learned about a new
church plant in Rome

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,720
called Breccia di Roma
and I met the pastor

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,060
and we began attending.

55
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,340
I serve at the church alongside Leonardo

56
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,190
as associate pastor.

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,010
The Lord provided for us to be
able to buy our own building

58
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,420
and that was an extremely
exciting and even significant day

59
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,500
because it was the first time since 1925

60
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,200
that in the city center of Rome,

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,760
an evangelical church or institution

62
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,740
had bought a piece of property.

63
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,420
It's in the heart of the city.

64
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,480
It's literally a stone's
throw from the Colosseum,

65
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,910
it's a short drive to the Vatican City.

66
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,490
It's surrounded by Catholic seminaries

67
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,290
that are very influential worldwide.

68
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,470
So it's a small place
but at the same time,

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,340
they're huge steps
forward for the presence

70
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,050
of the gospel on the culture
and the people who live there.

71
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,130
- The first time that we met,

72
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,630
I was impressed by Reid and Kyra and by

73
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,820
asking them what's your
dream, what's your desire,

74
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,960
are you ready to die here?

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,780
And Reid and Kyra told me,
"Yes, we are ready to die here.

76
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,390
"This is our home."

77
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,940
They had just arrived and they knew

78
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,180
that their calling was a
long-term calling of God

79
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,990
and they certainly had counted the cost.

80
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,940
- We're talking about doing ministry

81
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,980
in a context that has been
shaped by one institution

82
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,860
for 2,000 plus years and
you don't just come in

83
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,946
and knock that down, even
probably in one lifetime.

84
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,760
It takes a long
commitment, it takes years,

85
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,618
it takes a lifetime.

86
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,610
(light music)

87
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,200
We had been living in Rome
for just about six years

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,340
together when we came up
on our second furlough,

89
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,230
so we went back to the
States for two months

90
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,390
and we were just about
ready to come back to Rome.

91
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,080
As we typically do before we head back

92
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,967
and we wanted to get together
with our family, have dinner,

93
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:35,870
and just enjoy each other's
company before heading back

94
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,560
and so we were driving
northbound on a highway

95
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,230
heading back home and
not really saying much,

96
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,255
just kind of reflective, I think.

97
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:47,840
And at one point, kind of noticed out of

98
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,640
my peripheral vision
that there was something

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,430
that just kind of seemed a little bit off.

100
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,410
There was a big 18-wheeler that was

101
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,480
entering into the road
perpendicularly to our vehicle

102
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,540
and just in a matter of a split second,

103
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,420
it hit us in the side and T-boned us

104
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,400
and rolled us over and pushed
us across the northbound lanes

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,240
of this highway and
then through the median

106
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,220
and then across the
southbound lane as well,

107
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,870
until we hit a guard rail.

108
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:29,380
And on the impact, Kyra
passed away immediately.

109
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,270
The hardest moment, for sure, was

110
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,210
the day me and the girls
walked into our apartment

111
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,400
for the first time without Kyra.

112
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,290
And, you know, there's this reality that

113
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,289
you could just feel the absence.

114
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:51,500
(somber music)

115
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,260
I do remember that first
time sitting down and

116
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,720
trying to prepare myself
mentally for prayer

117
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,470
and talking to God and
it was just a really big,

118
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,830
it kind of is a test of your faith.

119
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,510
There was definitely kind
of these real moments of,

120
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,430
I don't even know what to say,
I don't know what to do or

121
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,277
how to even pray.

122
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:22,240
I think it was after the funeral that

123
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,760
I really had time to really
sit down and consider

124
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,130
what does the future look like for us.

125
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,850
- We're driving from
the airport to Atlanta

126
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,840
and I whisper to Reid,

127
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,120
"Reid, the Lord needs you here in Rome,

128
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,780
"and I strongly encourage
you to consider coming back

129
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,830
"and to continue to serve
the cause of the gospel

130
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,260
"in this city."

131
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,170
- I really didn't even allow myself that

132
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,980
possibility, just knowing
what it would take.

133
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,320
Although there was a desire

134
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,050
to think about going back to Rome,

135
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,070
it just didn't even seem
feasible or possible.

136
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,630
Like, how am I going to come back
and raise three little girls?

137
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,722
At the time, they were six, four, and two.

138
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:16,170
And then being a single
dad who's, you know,

139
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,890
got a job and responsibilities to do

140
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,270
and knowing that there I don't
have family around to help.

141
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,790
Thinking about going back to
Rome seemed insurmountable,

142
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:41,020
really, as a possibility.

143
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,730
I thought about my neighbors.

144
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,870
I thought about our friends,

145
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,020
thinking about people like Luca and Helena

146
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:55,333
who are good people, but
they didn't know Christ.

147
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,560
The Lord just totally changed
my perspective on things,

148
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,830
being reminded of the
tremendous lostness here.

149
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,410
And just knowing the need
for a gospel reformation here

150
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,820
that may or may not come in my lifetime,

151
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,680
but I wanted to be a part of that

152
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,970
and wanted to contribute in some way.

153
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,530
The Lord made it very clear that

154
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,900
going back to Rome was what
the Lord was calling me

155
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,450
and the girls to do.

156
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,870
But that doesn't mean
it's going to be easy.

157
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,170
It's going to be difficult,

158
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,770
but if the Lord's calling me to do this,

159
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:41,530
I know that He will provide
and He'll make it possible.

160
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,930
- Reid's decision to come back to Rome

161
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,110
has affected the church tremendously.

162
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,010
And not only for the church,
but also for his friends

163
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,380
and non-believing neighbors.

164
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:58,250
- When he met us after the accident,

165
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,740
he was there with a smile

166
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,690
and it was so shocking for me.

167
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,640
There is no way to understand
that if you haven't faith

168
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,180
because it's impossible.

169
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,560
- The fact that a young
man would come back

170
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,820
in such conditions was a
clear example of the way

171
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,960
in which the grace of God
works in people's lives.

172
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,170
- When I met the Karr family,

173
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,160
I didn't believe and for me,

174
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,490
the important was my life and myself.

175
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,080
Little by little, I started
to think about my life.

176
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,750
From that time, everything changed.

177
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,040
- We have seen conversions happening after

178
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,610
Reid's decision to come
back because it was

179
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,880
such a powerful testimony of the gospel

180
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,520
working in people's lives.

181
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,410
- Today, our life is totally changed.

182
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:14,100
God is in every moment of our life.

183
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,800
Without Kyra and Reid, we
would never change our life.

184
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,555
- If Kyra saw what ministry
was like for us today,

185
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:30,430
of course her heart would
overflow with joy to see

186
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,625
Helena and Luca coming to
church, being baptized,

187
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,590
living their lives for God and the Lord.

188
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,650
She would certainly rejoice
in the fruit that's come

189
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,130
since her passing.

190
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,460
If you had told me what
was going to happen,

191
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,130
you're going to go home on furlough,

192
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,540
you're going to be just about to come back

193
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,970
but then Kyra's going to be
killed in a freak accident,

194
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,680
and then you're going to
take the girls back yourself

195
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,750
and raise them, I would
have just laughed at you

196
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,840
and said that's absolutely
ridiculous and crazy,

197
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,590
it's not possible.

198
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,990
Doing ministry and taking care
of the girls and being a dad

199
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,410
and people asking me, how do you do it?

200
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,150
I was like, I don't know, the Lord,

201
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,760
it gives an opportunity
to brag on the Lord

202
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,880
and say He's just so gracious,

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,720
He gives us the grace we need.

204
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,640
One lesson that I believe
the Lord's taught me

205
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,680
more than any other is that
His grace is sufficient.

206
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,410
No matter the challenge
that He places before you,

207
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,520
no matter what scenario He puts you in,

208
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,310
you can think it's completely impossible,

209
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,800
but if He allows it and He puts you in it,

210
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,540
then He's going to provide for you.

211
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,140
And even when we think
things are impossible,

212
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,440
God's grace is sufficient.
