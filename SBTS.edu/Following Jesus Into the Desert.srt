1
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:10,830
the UAA is situated literally in the

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,500
middle of the 1040 window it is

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,669
basically situated in the middle of the

4
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,859
eastern hemisphere so you do have the

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,510
entire world that's come to this country

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,379
the locals themselves make up about 13%

7
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:24,210
of the population which is just

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,268
mind-blowing 87% are from around the

9
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:29,629
world God's drawing the nation's here

10
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,090
it's a nation of unreached peoples so

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,619
it's a strategic crossroads for the

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,619
gospel and it by God's grace has allowed

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,359
for evangelical Christians to be here

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,009
and to do ministry what if I meet

15
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:43,710
someone here that who comes from a

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,509
people group that have never heard the

17
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,420
gospel and maybe the one I reach today

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,570
tomorrow is the first one and maybe

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,189
they're the ones who have taken the

20
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,238
opportunity so right through that the

21
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:59,369
needier is for preachers of the gospel

22
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:00,600
romans 10

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
how will they call upon him whom they've

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,010
not heard how will they hear without a

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,950
preacher so there's a need for people to

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,319
come and preach the good news of the

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,510
Lord Jesus Christ

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,959
[Music]

29
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,519
you don't get these opportunities much

30
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,930
and if you don't take them you miss them

31
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,959
so we felt kind of that Mead and if the

32
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,219
Lord was in this that he would just open

33
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,349
the doors and he has we had no plan B

34
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:31,069
there's no no plan for after this we're

35
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:33,109
settling here and investing ourselves

36
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:34,700
here we are only here because the Lord

37
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,009
made it happen and so the things that

38
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,030
are happening are only because the

39
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,829
Lord's making them happen for seven or

40
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:42,250
eight years we've been training pastors

41
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,930
evangelists the Lord has really he's

42
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,090
moved among us over the years it's been

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,519
a true reform we're at people ask me why

44
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,009
here do by cos Craig price is here I

45
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,280
want to be where Jesus is and if that

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,950
means literally in the desert in the

47
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,280
wilderness sure all I'm really

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,439
encouraged by how the Lord's brought so

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,759
many graduates from Southern to come

50
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,859
here to serve in the ministry things

51
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,469
Southern is focused on good theology

52
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:12,199
lived out for the good of the nations

53
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,569
find its home here the Lord is at work

54
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,030
in this part of the world obviously it's

55
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,159
not making headline news but the Lord is

56
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,530
at work and he is building his church

57
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,000
we're in the midst of a revival here

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,729
there's more people coming to feed in

59
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,409
Africa and India and the Middle East

60
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:30,110
then there is an America the gospel is

61
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,150
speeding ahead you can go is more

62
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,949
worship for Jesus and more people

63
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:43,159
who have been saved and will be with us

64
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,924
on the last day
